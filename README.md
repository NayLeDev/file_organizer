#File Oraganizer

"file_organizer.py" is a versatile Python script designed to simplify the often tedious task of file organization within a directory. Users are presented with the option to either utilize the default base path or specify a custom one, offering flexibility in various scenarios.

The script excels in categorizing files based on their extensions, automatically creating distinct folders for each file type. For instance, imagine having a cluttered downloads folder with various files such as images, documents, and spreadsheets. By running "file_organizer.py," the script would intelligently sort these files into separate directories, enhancing overall file management.

Furthermore, users have the ability to exclude specific files from the organization process. This feature proves invaluable when there are files that should remain untouched or in their original location.

Here's an example of how to use the script:

```bash
python file_organizer.py
```

The script prompts the user to choose between the default base path and entering a custom path. Afterward, it organizes the files, creating folders for each extension and moving the files accordingly. Users can also specify files to exclude from this process by providing their names.

"file_organizer.py" empowers users to maintain a well-organized file system effortlessly, reducing clutter and improving overall productivity.
